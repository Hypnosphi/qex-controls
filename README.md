##QEX-controls

This is a library of UI blocks based on a number of modern front-end technologies which transparently demonstrates our approach to Single Page Applications.

In accordance with [MVVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) approach every block provides abstracted API based on [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and takes care about data bindings between state and DOM. The file structure of each block is designed for easiest build integration and better control with dependencies declarations.

Examples and testing stand are available on [gh-pages](http://maetchkin.github.io/qex-controls/?#Top)

This library supports newest browsers (FF, Chrome, Safari) and designed mostly for fast development purposes, including fast building sketches, prototypes of our SPA.
